This repo has adapted the book's [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) tests & implementation to [PHP](https://php.net), within the context of the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4 "Laravel 5.4 Documentation") framework.

Tests:

```
/tests/Unit/BottlesTest.php
```

Final implementation:

```
/app/Bottles.php
/app/BottleNumber.php
/app/BottleNumber0.php
/app/BottleNumber1.php
/app/BottleNumber6.php
```

"99 Bottles of OOP" was a fantastic learning resource and I highly recommend it. All killer, no filler!
